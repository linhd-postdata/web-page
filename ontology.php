            <p>The starting point for the development of the ontology is <a
                    href="http://postdata-prototype.linhd.uned.es/domain-model.php" target="new">the domain model for
                    European Poetry</a>.
                This model was created through a process of inverse engineering in order to retrieve the informational
                needs of the community of practise. These are analysis of patterns, establishment of functional and non-functional
                requirements.The resulting conceptual model presents a great complexity because of its exhaustiveness
                and due to the various conceptual domains that were explored. It covers both the
                bibliographical and technical information of the works, and also metadata derived from literary
                and prosodic analysis. Moreover, it includes elements that are complementary elements of the texts
                like images and musical notation.
            </p>

            <p>In order to reduce the complexity of the model, we began by identifying 
                knowledge areas and defining a series of subdomains.</p>
            <p>Thus, we identified the following subdomains (see illustration below):
            <ul>
                <li>A central subdomain with the concepts and properties for the representation of the poetic work.</li>
                <li>A subdomain with the necessary entities to deal with the aspects of the transmission of the poetic
                    work.
                </li>
                <li>A subdomain with the necessary concepts and properties to describe the structural elements of a poetic work.</li>
                <li>A subdomain with the necessary concepts and properties to describe the prosodic elements of a
                    poem.
                </li>
                <li>A subdomain to incorporate the necessary knowledge for the literary analysis of the work.</li>
                <li>A subdomain dealing with musical concepts and properties related to the work.</li>
                <li>A subdomain that deals with the conceptualization of entities complementary to the works, such as
                    illustrations.
                </li>
                <li>A generic subdomain with the necessary concepts and properties for the representation of agents,
                    places and related events and roles.

            <p>
                Therefore, the development of an ontological model for European poetry has been carried out through a
                modular design that is derived, initially, from the subdomains identified in the domain model.
                Subdomains have a well defined semantics but it is necessary to make refinements to determine which of
                the subdomains corresponds to a complete and independient ontology and which should be merged
                with others to create a larger ontology.</p>
            <p>The modular design results in several ontologies which are connected in a network of ontologies for
                European poetry.
                We tooh into account the following criteria:
            <ul style="list-style: none">
                <li>

                    i. The classes, relations and axioms of the ontology are thematically related. In this case, it is a
                    question of guaranteeing that the underlying semantics of each class is related to the area of
                    knowledge.
                </li>

                <li>ii. Weak coupling, that is, the ontology must present sufficient autonomy which means that it is a
                    self-contained ontological module that preserves the relationships with other ontologies (Oh, Yeom, &
                    Ahn, 2011).
                </li>

                <li>iii. Strong cohesion, that is, the ontology must have the maximum number of properties between
                    classes to achieve a high degree of cohesion in the ontology, which describes the functionality of
                    the ontology and avoid as much as possible the coupling with other ontologies, i.e. the degree of
                    interdependence between ontologies is small.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br/><br/>

            <h4>Metrics</h4>
            <p>To measure the degrees of cohesion, we applied a metric proposed in Oh, Yeom, & Ahn (2011), which
                measures the cohesion of the modules, i.e. the ontologies, independently of the cohesion of the
                ontological network. This metric takes into account a factor that ensures the quality of the module.
                This factor is the degree of internal relations in the module, that is, the degree of cohesion present
                in the module that undoubtedly influence the coupling with other modules. This also makes it possible to
                verify the logical consistency between the modules and the complete ontology.</p>

            <p>Cohesion in an ontology module has to do with the degree of relationship of the classes in the module.
                Classes are related when they share properties or have connections with other classes. Therefore, the
                relations contemplated in this metric can be both hierarchical (the properties of the parent are
                shared) and non-hierarchical (the classes connect to each other). </p>
            <ul>
                <li><h5>Cohesion</h5>
                    <div class="first-row">
                        <img src="images/metrica.png" width="40%"/><br/>Formula 1. Cohesion calculation formula
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li><h5>Coupling</h5>For this measure, we considered the dependencies established with other modules of the ontology (through import),
                    thar are necessary to complete the defined module.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>


            <div><p>For every subdomain, we carried out different analysis to obtain:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Identification of the own classes of the subdomain and identification of possible refinements in
                        the definition of the classes
                    </li>
                    <li>Identification of the attributes or data properties of each of the classes</li>
                    <li>Identification of the object properties that are resolved within the subdomain that is being
                        modeled
                    </li>
                    <li>Definition of cardinalities and obligatory restrictions</li>
                    <li>In all cases, we considered the reuse and alignment of ontologies and ontological patterns</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>The network of ontologies</h3>
            <p>From this process, we identified the following ontologies as part of the network of ontologies for
                the domain of European poetry</p>


            <h4><a href="http://postdata.linhd.uned.es/ontology/postdata-core/">1. postdata-core ontology <span

                                                                                    data-fa-mask=""></i></span></span></a>
            </h4>
            <p>This ontology covers aspects related to poetic works and their manifestations.</p>
            <P>The classes PoeticWork, Redaction and Ensemble have been defined for this purpose.</P>
            <P>Since it is the core or central ontology of the network, we incorporated classes that are not specific to poetry
                but that represent a transversal knowledge. These
                classes complete the relevant information not only for the classes of the core ontology but also for
                other ontologies of a more specific domain. </P>
            <P>The following entities have therefore been identified:
            <ul>
                <li>Person and Organisation, to model the agents that participate in the poetic work with different
                    roles.
                </li>
                <li>CreatorRole and Role that model the authorship or creation of the works and elements related to the
                    manifestation and transmission like editors or scribed, for example.
                </li>
                <li>Place and Event, to represent places of origin and mentioned events (and places).</li>
            </ul>
            </P>
            <p>The core ontology is imported by the rest of ontologies of the network. For this reason, besides
                containing the mentioned classes, it also provides a set of common properties that have the same
                semantics in all the classes in which they are defined. In this way it is possible to express semantics
                in an unambiguous way for properties that from this point of view represent conceptually the same
                thing. </p>

            </h4>
            <p>The data properties related to the dating of the work, its
                manifestations and its transmission, contain different features to capture the specifics of the
                expression of the date in this domain. We needed to take into consideration the difficulty of dating works
                according to established formats. Dates cannot always be defined with accuracy and this
                entails the need of additional elements to describe the dating issues.
                Therefore, we created a small ontology of
                dates to better represent datation issues when dealing with historical data and periods.</p>

                The classes that form it are: Syllable, Line, Stanza, Word and Punctuation, these last two belong to
